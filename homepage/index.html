    <h1>On the joy of html</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Now, I know this might sound <em>strange</em> to you, but what I'm going to do right now is fill and
        entire webpage with terrible looking lorem ipsum since I don't really wanto to delve into CSS at this point.</p>
    <p><strong>Let's start</strong>, <em>shall we?</em></p>

    <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ipsa error doloribus, a mollitia aliquam, 
        corporis dolore modi magnam est architecto aspernatur maxime exercitationem laudantium molestiae. 
        Hic nesciunt voluptatem perspiciatis animi.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Isn't it strange how actually <em>cool</em> plain html looks in 2023?</h4>
    <p>Just think about it: we are now so used to all kinds of different styles and animations and all sorts of things that
        going back to the semplicity and tidyness of plain <strong>HTML</strong> actually makes kind of sense.

    <h3>On the semantic difference between the strong, em, b and i tags</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>strong</strong> tag is used when we want to indicate the importance, seriousness, 
            or urgency of a word or section of content without changing the meaning of the content itself.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>em</em> tag places stress emphasis on a particular piece of content in a way that changes the actual meaning of the content. 
            Whenever we want to emphasize something in our markup with verbal stress, we should use <em>em</em> tags.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <i>i</i> tag is used to convey a different mood or voice from the surrounding content. 
            It's often used with foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, ship names, thoughts, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>b</b> tag draws attentions to word or section of content for utilitarian purposes without conveying extra importance, emphasis, alternate voice or mood, etc.
            It is the least semantic of the HTML tags we've discussed in this post, and should only be used when no other tag is more appropriate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to start coding in html:</h3>
